Cassandra backup/restore scripts
================================

This set of scripts enables to backup single keyspace from a single Cassandra DB node.


Creating backup
---------------

Backing up single keystore is done by using 'cassandra_backup_keyspace.sh' script.

```
$ cassandra_backup_schema.sh {keyspace_name}
```
This will produce backup archive file with name pattern: '{keyspace_name}-{timestamp}.tar.bz2'.

Note that backup script will not delete Cassandra snapshot directory and/or its contents.


Backup archive format
---------------------

Format of backup archive is following:

archive_file/
            |-schema.cql
            |-snapshot/
                      |-table_directory_1
                      |-table_directory_2
                      |...
                      |-table_directory_n

'schema.cql' file contains dump of keyspace schema.
'snapshot' directory contains directories with snapshot of SSTable files.


Restoring backup
----------------

Restoring of backed up snapshot is done using 'cassandra_restore_keyspace.sh'.
Restore script needs root privileges, it can be run with either 'su' or 'sudo'.

```
$ cassandra_restore_schema.sh {archive_file}
```
This will drop backed up keyspace, if it exists, re-create it from backed-up schema, and copy
backed-up tables to Cassandra data dir.
Note that this process will destroy any existing data in specified keyspace.

Restore script will check if backup archive format adheres to expected format, but it cannot
guarantee data validity.
